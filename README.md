# Network Intrusion Detection System
<p>Intrusion detection system is able to classify a malicious packet into intrusion attack classes based upon the ML Model Prediction.
Network sniffer is used to analyze real time network traffic at an interface and parse into NSL-KDD99 attributes.
network intrusion detector model predict the legitimacy of the
packets with an accuracy of ~94%.</p><br>
